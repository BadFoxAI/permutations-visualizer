# Permutations Visualizer

An interactive web-based tool for visualizing permutations with customizable parameters.

## Description

This project provides a visual representation of permutations based on user-defined parameters such as the number of places, base (number of colors), and display mode. It's designed to help users understand and explore the concept of permutations in a visually engaging way.

## Features

- Adjustable number of places (1-64)
- Customizable color palette (up to 10 colors)
- Three display modes: Binary, Decimal, and Visual
- Adjustable items per page (10-256)
- Zoom functionality to change cell size
- Pagination for large permutation sets

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/BadFoxAI/permutations-visualizer.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

No additional installation or dependencies are required as this is a standalone HTML/CSS/JavaScript application.

## Usage

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
2. Use the controls on the left side of the page to adjust the visualization parameters:
   - Slide the "Places" control to change the number of digits in each permutation.
   - Use the color pickers to customize the color palette.
   - Select a display mode from the dropdown menu.
   - Adjust the "Items per page" and "Cell Size" sliders as needed.
3. The visualization will update in real-time as you change the parameters.
4. Use the "Previous" and "Next" buttons to navigate through pages of permutations.
